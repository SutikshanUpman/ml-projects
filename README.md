# Machine Learning Projects

This repository serves as a curated index and management hub for my machine learning work.
Each project is maintained as an independent repository with its own history.

## Core Projects

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction :
Implemented an end-to-end ML workflow using scikit-learn Pipelines, feature engineering, 
and GridSearchCV for systematic model selection.
